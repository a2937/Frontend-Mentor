# FrontEnd Mentor Practice

This is my attempt on taking on a bunch of [FrontEnd Mentor Challenges](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges)
with pure HTML,CSS, and Javascript. Some of the projects will be remade to use a Front-End framework at
a later date and given my own unique style.

## Accessing the projects

Navigate to the [Github Pages Site](https://a2937.github.io/Frontend-Mentor) to get started.
Then use the scrollbar to search for the project you are interested in seeing as well as description of
the challenges I had when working with the project.
